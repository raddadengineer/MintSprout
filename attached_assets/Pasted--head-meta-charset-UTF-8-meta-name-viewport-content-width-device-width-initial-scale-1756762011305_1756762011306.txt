  <h1>Elmo‚Äôs Spend, Share, and Save Jars</h1>
  <p class="description">
    Learn how to make smart choices with money alongside Elmo, Louie, and Abby! This lesson introduces three special jars that help kids understand the basics of spending, saving, and sharing in a fun, hands-on way.
  </p>
  <h2>The Three Magic Jars:</h2>
  <div class="jar" style="border-color: #ffb703;">
    üè∫ <strong>SPEND Jar</strong> ‚Äì Money for things you want to buy soon, like a toy or treat.
  </div>
  <div class="jar" style="border-color: #219ebc;">
    üê∑ <strong>SAVE Jar</strong> ‚Äì Money to keep for something special you want later, like a bike or game.
  </div>
  <div class="jar" style="border-color: #e63946;">
    ‚ù§Ô∏è <strong>SHARE Jar</strong> ‚Äì Money to help others or give gifts to people you care about.
  </div>
  <p>
    When you get money, you get to decide how much goes in each jar! There are no wrong choices ‚Äì it‚Äôs all about what matters to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some kids put most money in their SPEND jar because they like getting things right away. Others love watching their SAVE jar grow bigger and bigger!
  </p>

    <h2>Fun Activity:</h2>
    <p>
      Get three containers and decorate them with stickers and drawings. Practice putting play money or real coins into each jar and talk about what you might do with each type of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember, even grown-ups use this same idea ‚Äì they just use bank accounts instead of jars!
